<h1> Rishi Bommasani</h1>
<p>
  I am a Senior Research Scholar at the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)</a>. 
  <br> I research the societal and economic impact of AI, especially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">foundation models</a>, to advance <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8449">evidence-based AI policy</a>. 
  <br> If you are interested in working with me, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/DNrKPeiJjdi4VgaR7">this form</a>.

  <br> <br> To improve AI governance, I have built the interface between AI researchers and policymakers through several major efforts in global AI policy: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/meet-chairs-leading-development-first-general-purpose-ai-code-practice">the EU AI Act and its Code of Practice</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/June-17-2025-%E2%80%93-The-California-Report-on-Frontier-AI-Policy.pdf">the California Report on Frontier AI Policy</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17805">the International Scientific Report on AI</a>.   My research has won multiple paper awards at top AI conferences and has been featured in
