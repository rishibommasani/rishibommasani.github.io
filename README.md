# Rishi's Personal Website

This is the code for my website: https://rishibommasani.github.io/.  
If you find errors on my website or would like to reuse it for your own purposes, contact me at rishibommasani@gmail.com.

## Local preview

Run the site locally (without pushing) using the GitHub Pages Jekyll stack:

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Serve locally with live reload: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
   - Visit http://localhost:4000 and make changes; the browser reloads on save.
3. To build without serving: `bundle exec jekyll build` (output goes to `_site/`, which is gitignored).
